# Palindrome Checker in TypeScript

This project is a simple palindrome checker refactored in TypeScript, originally developed for an assignment at Business College Helsinki.

## Overview

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same backward as forward, such as "madam" or "racecar". This application allows users to enter any text and check if it is a palindrome.

## Features

- User Input Validation: Cleans input with regex to ensure it is suitable for a palindrome check.
- Palindrome Detection: Efficiently checks if the input text is a palindrome.
- TypeScript Refactoring: Refactored existing JavaScript codebase into TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience.
- Nice UI: A minimalist user interface for easy use and interaction.

## Usage

Enter any text into the input field. The application will display whether the entered text is a palindrome.
